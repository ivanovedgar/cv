If you are looking for a professional with three years of IT industry experience, with fluent level of both written and spoken English and an ability to work on a shift pattern, please find my resume attached.

I am writing to apply for the Junior Unix Technician position at Barclays Technology Centre, Lithuania that has been advertised on your careers website.

While at SECRETSALES I have provided all levels of IT support to the internal users ranging from the simple software maintenance on the local machines and up to the management of the virtualized Windows Server infrastructure running AD, DNS, DHCP, Exchange and file sharing services.
As part of my day-to-day responsibilities I was writing scripts to automate day-to-day tasks and contributing to the office procedures, carefully documenting new issues and their resolution. Supporting heterogeneous environment running Windows, Mac and Linux systems provided me with the opportunity to expand my knowledge in the remote system management using ssh/rdp protocols and command line tools such as grep, ping, ifconfig, chmod, ps and df. 
Working closely with developers to quickly and efficiently resolve any issues affecting our live customer base improved my communication skills while operation tasks enhanced my SQL knowledge and allowed to resolve new issues in a more creative and efficient way.

My degree scheme at University of Wales, Aberystwyth, included professional training: I have secured the industrial year placement at Information Services department of Aberystwyth University. Providing 2nd and 3rd line technical support to almost 10,000 University members had enhanced my ability to work to a schedule and my organisation skills, as the deadlines in the busy periods were tough and required me to manage the time properly. 

My day-to-day activities included investigating problems with the malfunctioning hardware and software, often working off site in the customers’ offices. I would also often provide technical support by phone to the lecturers in the classrooms when they were having problems with the projectors, laptops as well as other IT equipment.  Helping clients via phone on a daily basis has developed my ability to help resolve problems of remote users quickly and efficiently: I tried to visualise what my clients were seeing and go through the problem together with them.

By the end of the day the job has helped me to learn how to think on my feet while also getting highly valuable experience of how to provide efficient service to the varied customer base. 

As part of the placement I have had an opportunity to enhance my knowledge of Apple Mac computers and became Certified Apple Macintosh Technician as a result of it.

With my employment at SECRETSALES coming to an end due to the decision taken to relocate to Vilnius, where my family is based, I am now ready for a new big challenge and joining large UNIX team operating across the world might just be it.

Aside from the accomplishments I described above, there are many others listed on my resume and I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss them with you.
Thank you for your time and attention considering my application, I look forward to meeting you and giving my interview.
