Tenacious Computer Science finalist on track for 2:1 degree with genuine passion for hardware and proven troubleshooting skills, I am writing to apply for the Junior Unix Technician position at Barclays Technology Centre Lithuania that has been advertised on your careers website. I want to pursue a career of IT Administrator because it requires continuous professional development through the career since new technologies in this field emerge every day; this fact makes the career challenging and interesting.

I open my own doors. When my peers look for a safe option, I search for challenge. When my friends went to universities back home in Lithuania, I travelled to study to UK, aged nineteen. I arrived without knowing anyone, with limited funds and made it work. By the end of my first year I got a job in a small town with limited employment opportunities, became financially independent from my parents and achieved consistent marks of 60\% upwards at university for the assignments and exams.

My degree scheme included professional training: I had to spend one year in industry working full-time and gaining experience.  I have secured the industrial year placement at Information Services department of Aberystwyth University. The placement has developed my ability to carry out maintenance of the computer software and hardware: I was installing, upgrading and configuring computer systems as well as providing face-to-face and phone support to the university staff and students. 

Most of the time I have been investigating problems with the malfunctioning hardware and software, often working off site in the customers offices and successfully solving problems. I was replacing hard drives, laptop screens, power jacks, motherboards, recovering data from the damaged media, reinstalling software. One of duties was installing Windows 7 on new computers which could be up to ten machines in a week. Usual installation process was taking way too much time and was not efficient. In my spare time I learned how to use Windows Automated Installation Kit and Windows Deployment Services which allowed me to build a Windows 7 image with all required additional software and keep it up to date with minimal effort, as well as deploy it on the several machines simultaneously, thus saving great amount of time to my and my customers. To automate some tasks required after the deployment I wrote PowerShell script which would finish up installation and join computer to the domain. 

I would often provide technical support by phone to the lecturers in the classrooms when they were having problems with the projectors, microphones or other IT  equipment. When helping them I would usually use my own experience and the list of most common solutions to the problems. Helping clients via phone on a daily basis has developed my ability to help resolve problems of remote users quickly and efficiently, I try to visualise what my clients see and go through the problem together with them.

The daily duties I had enhanced my ability to work to a schedule and my organisation skills as the deadlines in the busy periods were tough and required me to manage the time properly. By the end of the day the job has helped me to learn how to think on my feet while also getting highly valuable experience of how to provide excellent customer service. I have also had an opportunity to learn how to repair Apple Mac computers. In a few month time I completed self paced training and after successfully passing the exams I became Certified Apple Macintosh Technician.

During my studies at university I was continuously developing my knowledge of computer architecture and hardware, network interconnection and traffic management. During the practicals I had an opportunity to apply my knowledge by configuring Windows Server 2008 and Fedora workstations for the use in a corporate environment; how to analyse traffic with Wireshark program to identify problems, monitor network usage, configuration of routers and switches. 

While at university I have learned several programming languages. In my first year I built application in Java with GUI where user could place and edit country flags on a world map and then be scored on the accuracy. One of my second year modules challenged me to build an application in C which would simulate ship movements in the sea and detect possible collisions. I have also built several websites with the use of PHP/HTML/CSS and MySQL database at the back end. In my final year I have gained extensive knowledge of Rubby on Rails while building back end for the quotation system to obtain car insurance policy. My final year project includes both hardware and software parts. I am building a system to stabilize pan and tilt unit based on the data from the inclinometer. This project involves reuse, improvement and extension of the already available C and C++ code.

Thank you for your time and attention considering my application. I am
looking forward to meet you and giving my interview.
